### Gitstats

The Gitstats output page seems to correlate pretty well with my findings, the lines of code is a bit off but I guess that's to be expected.

The results of `gitstats` are a bit different than the stats from `git`, but
they're in the same ballpark. For example, 33 contributors vs. 39 contributors,
and ~62,000 lines of code vs. ~53,000 lines of code.
