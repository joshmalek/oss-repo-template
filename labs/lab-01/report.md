#### My thoughts on Chapter 3 of Free Culture

  We've always known that large corporations are increasingly inconsiderate of the common people, even more so to make a point.  In this case of Jesse vs. the RIAA, the lawsuit was just the RIAA lawyers flexing the incredibly stringent copyright law they themselves had written and lobbied.  Picking on the little man, and willing to settle for the entire net worth of a college student to make a point is simply another day, and the cost of the publicity is worth the opportunity to make an example out of a largely innocent victim.  In recent days especially, we've seen that when it comes down to the common man and corporations, they don't care about you.  

  Robinhood and other brokers have shown their true colors lately, when faced with the opportunity to support the 99%, they chose to throw in lots with the 1%.  And when push comes to shove, it will happen again.  People like Jesse are innocent, and I'm not sure the same thing could happen in today's society and the incredible stopping power of social media.  If this case came out again today, people like Jesse might have more power against corporations just trying to make an example.
